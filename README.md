This Home Automation project is designed to control and monitor environmental parameters using Arduino. It utilizes sensors such as the PIR motion sensor and the LM35 temperature sensor to automate tasks like turning on an LED light and activating a motor based on certain conditions. The system displays real-time temperature readings and motion status on an LCD screen, making it a practical solution for simple home automation needs.

Key features include:
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Displays the current room temperature on an LCD using the LM35 sensor.
- **Motion Detection**: Uses a PIR sensor to detect motion and triggers actions like turning on/off an LED.
- **Motor Control**: Activates a motor when the temperature exceeds 20Â°C and motion is detected.
  
This project serves as a foundation for building more advanced home automation systems and can be easily modified to suit various use cases.
